The goal of meta4 is to enable non-technical entrepreneurs to build a rich, functional web applications in just a few days, so they can start validating their ideas and selling to customers sooner.

That means you can create responsive, feature-rich prototypes, MVPs or DevOps apps that target both mobiles and desktops - little or no coding required.

meta4 helps you to experiment, test hypotheses and iterate towards product/market fit before investing  into hard-coded software. 

You describe what you want to achieve, and let meta4 worry about the 'how'.
