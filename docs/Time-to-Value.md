This became a key phrase during meta4 development. 

We wanted to try a declarative syntax and see what happens when the applications just does what it's told.

Our goal was that within 10 minutes, a junior developer should be building an application.

Given enough determination, a non-coder could boot up their first demo within a few hours. And over a  weekend, they could build out a pleasant looking, decent sized, prototype. Without coding.

We believe, that sticking to JSON as the primary design language it empowers non-developers to contribute more directly to the software creation.

Also, by constraining one's imagination to common widgets and interaction patterns, it would be easy to learn.

We hope you'll help us to refine our vision, and reduce the time-to-value of software development even further.
