Getting Started
---------------

meta4 MVP is self-contained runtime for rapidly prototyping web applications.

Let's build a simple demo in a few seconds ...


1) To install 'meta4mvp' from NPM, type:

    $ npm install meta4mvp -g

2) To initialize a new MVP project, type:

    $ mkdir my_mvp

    $ cd my_mvp

    $ git init

    $ npm init

    $ meta4mvp --initialize

3) To build your skeleton MVP, type:

    $ meta4mvp

** meta4mvp is reading your ./build directory to find out what to build 

4) To start your engines, type:

    $ meta4

** meta4 is reading meta4.json and ./src/ to boot your MVP

Your MVP should start-up and announce that it's listening on port 8090.

5) Browse the demo at:
